 ** Non-Objectives
 ** Dependencies (Java version, other specifications)
 ** Optional features
 ** Document conventions
 
 * Fundamentals
 ** Execution of a Java Application archive
 *** how to execute on commad line
 *** as plain JAR, using runtime, define runtime as a dependency (JAR gets the runtime and executes it embedded)
 ** Classloader topology
 *** Nested JAR packages and class folders
 
 * link:types-of-archives.adoc[Types of executable archives]
 ** Standalone archive
 *** JAR or WAR
 ** Deployable archive
 *** to be deployed to a runtime, which itself can be a standalone archive
 *** WAR
 *** JAR with an application class
 ** Runtime JAR file - same as standalone JAR but supports some cmd line arguments for deployment of deployable archive
 ** Light archive
 *** JAR or WAR
 *** Requires an embeddable runtime in classpath
