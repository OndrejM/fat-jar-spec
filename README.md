# fat-jar-spec
A proof of concept for a common specification of a fat jar structure.

Inspired by a [thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/microprofile/sWOal05ORT0) in MicroProfile.io maling list.
It is just a proof of concept for me to play with, but the vision is to support the discussion and raise it as a sub-project of MicroProfile.io initiative.
Cooperation is welcome.
